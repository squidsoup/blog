# About me

I'm a software engineer in Dunedin, New Zealand, currently working on [Stacklet](https://stacklet.io), an exciting new platform for multi-cloud governance.

In the past I worked at [Canonical](https://canonical.com/), where I managed the team responsible for the [MAAS](https://maas.io/) frontend.

I occasionally write music as [Lawnbird](https://lawnbird.bandcamp.com/).
